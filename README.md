# Musician-Connect

A web application that allows musicians to connect with each other within their communities. The application will have some similarities to Faceboork in that it will be a social platform. User's will create a profile and explain what their musical interests and abilities are as well as their location. They will also be able to search or see musicians with similar interests and abilities in their general location. The ultimate goal is for the musicians to then meet up and begin playing, talking about, listening to, or gathering together all in the name of the music they love
